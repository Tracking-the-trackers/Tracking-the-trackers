First introduced in the mid-nineties as a way of recording client-side state, cookies have proliferated widely on the Web, and have become a fundamental part of the Web ecosystem. However, there is widespread concern that cookies are being abused to track and profile individuals online for commercial, analytical and various other purposes. Consequently, there has been an explosion of research into understanding the prevalence of tracking on the Web, and the resulting leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). In this tutorial, we aim to introduce the audience to state-of-the-art empirical measurement methods and techniques that are being used to understand and quantify web tracking in-the-wild.



## Introduction to Privacy (14:00 BST)
Introduce the audience to basic concepts and techniques, with examples from recent research.


### Types/means of tracking ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xN4eDoda5JVwajeW5RqkrpD09usYB8GQ_5nZ4r1ojfI/edit?usp=sharing))
* Cookies
* Cookie Synchronization
* Invisible pixels
* Device Fingerprinting
* CNAME Cloaking Tracking


### Legislation and Perceptions of Privacy ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12iHy-H8nYRD7VYq74m6zTQEbsiV2tuogHsmC63pLIpQ/edit?usp=sharing))
* GDPR (EU)
* CCPA (CA)
* PIPEDA (Canada)/LGPD (Brazil)
* Privacy across the world (emerging markets)

### Ethics & Research ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bCyiqwpBhBrHitSF7ttxD_p-N78Aj4es16XkJYfRylE/edit?usp=sharing))
* Tracking as internet-mediated research 
* The Belmont Report 
* Basic ethical principles 
* Theories of data privacy 
* Ensuring ethics and privacy of Internet-mediated research


### Methods 
* Automated measurements (OpenWPM and barebone Selenium) ([Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y4Kdhy4viGHQ8dDkIOmT_IZUHK9V7Odf/view?usp=sharing)) ([Installations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJQW2_0lBQenRbkB9gDy8sY7s8FBkfN8_pThHnfRDX0/edit?usp=sharing))
* Human-centered measurements (Browser extensions) ([Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IanDbMQU3ujs_gaKkJYzD2CdE87RBgAe/view?usp=sharing))


## Coffee Break  (15 min)

## Practicals against Tracking  (15:45 BST)
Hands-on experience into state-of-the-art tools and techniques, including some developed by the tutorial organisers.
As well as some instructions for our github repositories and data sets.


### Automated measurements 
* How to install / launch OpenWPM
* What to do when anti-crawling mechanisms are deployed
* What options / settings available
* How to build synthetic profiles
* What data should be collected

### Human-centered measurements
* How to create a browser extension
* Monitoring and collecting user activity
* What data should be collected
* Handling informed consent

### Interpreting results 
* Aggregating and visualizing data
* Interpreting results
